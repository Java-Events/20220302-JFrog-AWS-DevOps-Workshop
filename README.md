# JFrog-FreeTier-JVM
Workshop for the JFrog FreeTier - JVM - Java and Kotlin

Do you have a private project, an open-source tool or want to do a POC? 
Do you already have the idea in mind and you wish to get started? 
On the other hand, are you looking for a suitable environment 
so that you get the best possible support for your development? 

JFrog offers you just the right tools for this. 
You can get access to the JFrog Platform and use it freely. 
Artifactory, Xray, pipelines and more and this means that a 
complete DevSecOps environment is at your disposal.

In this workshop, I will show you the individual components 
step by step and help you set them up for your project. 
This workshop is divided into several parts, 
and each deals with a specific section of the development.

In the basic module, we will set up a project based on maven consisting 
of one module so that you can get started with Java and Kotlin. 

We will set up repositories as well as carry out the first security scans. 
The workshop is rounded off with the use of pipelines 
to provide your project with a simple CI pipeline.

## Requirements on your side

### The IDE
You need an IDE that supports Java and maven. 
I personally using IntelliJ and the screencasts are based on this IDE. 
The free version is perfect for this workshop. But you can use whatever IDE fits your needs.

#### IDE Support for Xray
To have IDE Support based on the Xray Plugin from JFrog, you need one of listed IDEs. 
The actual list is under the 
following URL [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/IDE+Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/IDE+Integration)

### Docker 
You need Docker on your machine for some parts of this tutorial. 
It is possible to skip this element during the workshop.

### Java and maven
This tutorial is based on Java version 8 or higher and maven. All JDKÂ´s should fit, there are no special 
requirements that I am aware of.
Maven is used in a version higher 3.3. Please make sure you have access to it.
You can use the bundled maven version. The archive is inside the folder **_data/maven** and contains
the maven version 3.6.3 as tar.gz file.


## Timetable and Agenda
The tutorial is planned to be done in approx 2h in total.

The BirdEyeView:
* Intro into the JFrog Platform
* A demo how to use a generic repo
* Docker and the first steps
* Maven and the HelloWorld
* Vulnerabilities and how to visualize them
* Pipelines Intro
* Bonus work - choose an OpenSource Project 
  and bring it into a fresh new FreeTier

10 min: Intro check out the git repository and get the Overview about the JFrog Platform in general
10 min: Short Navigation inside the JFrog Platform as an admin
10 min: Generic Repos and what you could do with it

## The tutorial itself
Lets start with the tutorial now! The plan is, to finish all steps in approx 2h.
I will give you from time to time some 
additional links to videos to provide additional informations.

### Access to the JFrog Platform
For this tutorial you can use the JFrog Platform based on the FreeTier offer.
This you will find under the URL [http://jfrog.com/start-free](http://jfrog.com/start-free). You do not need credit card 
informations for this and the FreeTier itself is not limited in time. 
If you want to see how to activate the FreeTier from JFrog, have a look at the following video on Youtube.

## Platform Overview
(EN) -
(DE) - 


## create a generic repo for Jabba
Create a generic repo called **generic-local-jabba**. 
Upload the files from your folder **_data/_jabba-0.11.2**
Try to download one file with **curl** and verify that it is a valid archive.
Delete the file **install.sh** from the repo.
Edit the file **install.sh** so that it is using your repository.
Hint: search for **svenruppert.jfrog.io** 
Upload this file again into your repo.

## create a generic repo for Maven
Repeat and adjust the steps from the previous section to get a 
generic repo called **generic-local-maven**. Upload the file from the 
folder **_data/maven**

## Repo access
Make sure that the two created repositories are accessible for the user *anonymous*.
 
## create a remote Docker Repo
Create a remote Docker Repo called **docker-remote-dockerio** 
with the target **https://registry-1.docker.io/** 
and try to pull the image **buildpack-deps:buster-curl**
Login into the new Docker Repo.

## create a local Docker Repo
Create a local Docker Repo with the name **docker-local**.
Login into the Docker Repo;

## create a virtual Docker Repo
Create a virtual DockerRepo called **docker-virtual** and include the both created Docker repos into it.
Define as default Deloyment Repository the local one.

Login into the Docker Repo as well: **docker login svenruppert-docker-virtual.jfrog.io**


## create a Generic Repo
Create a generic repo and load Jabba into it
change the Dockerfile to get this one used
How to extract the credentials from the UI

Do the same with the maven aproach




## create a remote Maven repo

## create a local maven repo

## create a virtual maven and Docker repo 

## secure your platform

## FreeTier Maintenance


## IDE Plugin - Scan for Vulnerabilities
In this section wwe want to scan our dependencies to learn more about vulnerabilities.
The tool that we are using is Xray and integrated into the JFrog Platform. 
It is able to scan all elements that are in Artifactory. Binaries, Buildinfos and so on. 
Your task now: Install the JFrog IDE Plugin and connect to your FreeTier installation.

## Xray - Watches
Inside the JFrog Platform you can analyse your binaries as well.
For this you need to create Rules, Policies and Watches.
Your next task is:
- create a Rule called **rule-catch-everything** that will scan for all Vulnerabilities.
- based on this Rule, create a Policy called **policy-overview** that consumes the Rule called **rule-catch-everything**
- Now it is time to combine the Policy with your repositories. Call the Watch **panic-watch**
The last step is to trigger the watch to see the results. For this start the re-calculation of the watch manually.

the official docu is here: 
Policies and Rules [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Creating+Xray+Policies+and+Rules](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Creating+Xray+Policies+and+Rules)

## AdHoc Vulnerabilities Report
Inside the JFrog Platform you can create AdHoc Vulnerabilities Reports. 
Create a Report called **ad-hoc-panic-report**, select the scope **Repositories** 
and choose all maven and docker repositories we created today. After this press the button **Generate Report**
Select the report and export it as pdf.

## Start with Pipelines






## How to use the Docker Images
In the following examples, I assume that maven organizes the project.
With gradle, it should be the same, but maybe different paths.

If you need a JDK only
```bash
docker run \
       --rm \
       --name run \
       -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src/mymaven \
       -w /usr/src/mymaven \
       svenruppert-docker-local-svenruppert.jfrog.io/svenruppert/adopt:1.8.0-172 \
       java -jar target/myapp.jar
```

If you need maven and a JDK
```bash
docker run \
       --rm \
       --name compile \
       -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src/mymaven \
       -w /usr/src/mymaven \
       svenruppert-docker-local-svenruppert.jfrog.io/svenruppert/maven-3.6.3-adopt:1.8.0-172 \
       mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```
